If you have a turtle named t, then â€¦
 Moving
t.forward(n) tells the turtle to move forward by n pixels.
t.back(n) tells it to move backward by n pixels.
               n can also be a negative number, in which case the movement will be reversed.
               t.forward(100) and t.back(-100) do the same thing.
t.speed(s) Sets the turtle's speed. Speed 0 is fastest.

Turning
t.right(a) tells it to turn right by an angle of a degrees.
t.left(a) tells it to turn left by an angle of a degrees.
               a can also be a negative number, in which case the turn will be reversed.
               t.left(-45) and t.right(45) do the same thing.
               The turtle starts out in the middle of the canvas, pointed to your right.
               Turns are always relative to the direction the turtle is currently facing

 Drawing
t.penup() tells it to pick its pen up, so it doesn't draw when it moves.
t.pendown() tells it to put its pen down again, so it does draw.
t.width(n) changes the width of the turtle's pen to be n pixels wide.
t.color(c) changes its color to a particular named color, where c is a string (or a variable
                 that has a string in it).
                 Examples:
                  t.color("blue")
                  pretty_color = "blue"
                  t.color(pretty_color)
                  Colors are named with strings such as "red", "white", or "chartreuse".
                  You can also use hex color codes such as "#ff0000", "#ffffff", or
                  "#7fff00".
                  The turtle starts out with its pen down, colored "black", and 1 pixel wide.

Hiding and showing
t.hideturtle() tells the turtle to hide itself so only the drawing shows.
t.showturtle() tells it to un-hide itself.
